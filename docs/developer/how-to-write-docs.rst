How to write docs
=================

Documentation for sysadmins
---------------------------

Documentation for sysadmins should contain a description of settings that allows
to setup and customize WaldurMasterMind. It should be located in
`wiki <https://opennode.atlassian.net/wiki/display/WD/MasterMind+configuration>`_.


Documentation for developers
----------------------------

If documentation describes basic concepts that are not related to any particular
part of code it should be located in /docs folder. All other documentation for
for developers should be located in code.

Tips for writing docs:
 - add description for custom modules that are unique for particular plugin;
 - add description to base class methods that should be implemented by other developers;
 - don't add obvious comments for standard objects or parameters.


API documentation
-----------------

TODO.
